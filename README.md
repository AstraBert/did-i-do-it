# did-i-do-it

DIDI (short for Did-I-Do-It?) is an app for people who forget, in their day-to-day life, which tasks they completed and which ones not. The idea is simple: you create tasks and, once you completed them, you do not only have the reward of feeling productive, but also a physical proof that yes, you did it - an email.
